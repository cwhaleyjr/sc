     * Changes to make sc build on NetBSD 1.5
       (Issue #3 reported by DNied@GitHub)
2016-04-14
     * Option -M (process mouse events)
2016-04-13       
     * When rows or columns are deleted (e.g. with "dr" or "dc"),            
       enclosed color ranges had not been deleted.  An attempt had been      
       made to fix this.   
     * Bugfix: Automatic color range removal in fix_crange() led to a        
       invalid pointer access crash. 
     * Bugfix: "set cslop/!cslop" had no visual effect an did set the        
       internal cslope value to the wrong (inverted) logical level.
     * Left mouse button support for edit/input line     
     * Bugfix: vi commands f,t,F,T: Buffer out of bounds access fixed        
2016-04-06       
     * Selecting cells with the left mouse button added. 
     * Bugfix: Scrolling upwards with ^Y did not check if top row is         
       already zero and decremented further.  This led to unpredictable      
       effects.  
2016-04-05       
     * On some terminals ^Y did suspend sc instead of scrolling the
       screen down.  This "delayed suspend" is now disabled (like in vi)     
       to make ^Y's scroll down function work on any terminal.     
     * Vertical scrolling using the mouse wheel possible after .scrc         
       command "set mouse"

       If the history had been saved and which filename was used for this    
       had been configured in the Makefile.  It is now possible to use       
       the command "histfile" in .scrc to set this filename or to disable    
       saving the history. 
2016-03-24       
     * Saving an existing database into a backup file before overwriting     
       had been controlled by the Makefile definition DOBACKUPS.  This is    
       removed now and replaced by the options backup/!backup which can      
       be set in .scrc     
     * By definition command 'W' writes the database into a file as it       
       appears on the screen.  This did not work for double quotes (") or    
       escaped double quotes (\").  Here the required escape characters      
       itself (\) had been displayed.  But sc does remove 1 or 2 '\'         
       before a '"' when drawing on the screen.
